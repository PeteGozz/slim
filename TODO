generic (petegozz)
-------
- trace auth issues with xorg
- check pam process path
- short out any systemd / *kit bloats

1.2.2
-----
- drawing problem on screens <= 1024x768 (implemented)
- Don't start X server if theme's not found

1.2.x
-----
- i18n
- don't choose a non-existing theme in random selection
- think about multi-line configuration:
    current_theme = t1, t2, t3
    current_theme = t4, t5
  or
    current_theme = t1, t2, t3 \
		    t4, t5
- FreeBSD fixes

2.0.x
-----
- restart X server on ctrl-alt-backspace
  -- works here. May be a side effect, Needs validation.

- allow switching theme on the fly if a set is specified in slim.conf
  --  low priority
  
- text alignment, to allow to center texts of unknown length (e.g. %host)
   percent seems to scope most of that
   
- re-instate (?) capslock warning

- re-work all messaging for slimlock
    -- user name placement
    -- disable F1
    -- test reboot etal
     

Devuan Preparations
-------------------
     - Move documentation to rst
       MarkDown as side effect for git sites may be useful.
     -- This is reasonable at the moment.
